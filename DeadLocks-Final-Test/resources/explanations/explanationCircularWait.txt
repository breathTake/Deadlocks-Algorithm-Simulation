eliminate Circular Wait:

Step 1: Initialization

At the beginning, all resources are available and unallocated.
Each process is either in the "running" state, "waiting" state, or "completed" state.

Step 2: Resource Request

When a process requests a resource, the system checks if the requested resources are available.
If the requested resources are available, they are allocated to the process, and the system updates the allocation status.

Step 3: Holding Resources

Once a process holds resources, it can request additional resources without releasing the ones it already holds.

Step 4: Releasing Resources

When a process finishes using the allocated resources, it releases them.
The released resources become available for allocation to other processes.

Step 5: Avoiding Circular Wait

To eliminate circular wait, the system must ensure that resource requests are made in a way that prevents a circular chain of waiting.
One common approach is to impose a total ordering on resources, assigning a unique number (timestamp) to each resource.
Processes are allowed to request resources in increasing order of their timestamps, preventing circular chains.

Step 6: Checking Request Order

Whenever a process requests a resource, the system checks if the requested resource's timestamp is greater than the timestamp of any resources the process is currently holding.
If the requested resource has a lower timestamp than any held resource, the system denies the request to maintain the order.

Step 7: Releasing Resources

A process can only release resources in decreasing order of their timestamps.
This order ensures that a higher timestamp resource is released before a lower timestamp resource.

Step 8: Enforcing the Rule

The system enforces the rule that a process can only request resources in increasing order of timestamps and release them in decreasing order.
This prevents a circular chain of waiting, as processes cannot request resources in a way that forms a cycle.

Step 9: Repeat

The process repeats as new resource requests and releases occur.
