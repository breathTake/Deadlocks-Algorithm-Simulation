Structure:
The simulation is an idealized version of a system with three processes (A, B and C) and four resource types (printers, CD-ROMs, plotters and tape drives).
Depending on the user's selection, several resources of each type are available, which can be occupied or free.

Requests:
When the processes get initialized, they get assigned a random list of resources (to simulate the random resource requests), after which they will request resources.
The reason for determining them before the process starts is that some algorithms (Banker's Algorithm and Eliminate Hold and Wait) need to know all the resources a process will request from the get-go.
For the other Algorithms, it doesn't matter as it does not make a difference in the context.

Holding Resources:
When a process has reserved a resource it will wait 2 seconds multiplied by the amount of the resource it reserved to simulate the process using the resource.
The resource will only be released again if the next resource is found or if it has processed all the resources it needs.

Running the simulation:
All the processes get started simultaneously so that they run in parallel. They start requesting and reserving resources and do so until they have used everything they need.
