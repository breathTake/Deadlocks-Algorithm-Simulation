Eliminate Hold and Wait:

To Eliminate Hold and Wait, every resource the process needs, needs to be free.

Step 1: Understand Hold and Wait

Make sure you have a clear understanding of what the "Hold and Wait" condition entails.
This condition occurs when a process holds resources while waiting to acquire additional resources,
preventing other processes from utilizing those resources.

Step 2: Resource Allocation Strategy

Implement a resource allocation strategy that ensures a process must request and acquire all its required resources simultaneously before execution begins. This approach prevents processes from holding resources while waiting for more, as they can't proceed until they have everything they need.

Step 3: Process Suspension

If a process cannot acquire all its resources at once, consider suspending the process temporarily until all necessary resources are available. This prevents the process from holding resources and allows other processes to utilize them in the meantime.

Step 4: Release Resources

Ensure that processes release any resources they are currently holding before making new requests. This prevents the accumulation of resources held by processes and reduces the risk of deadlock.
