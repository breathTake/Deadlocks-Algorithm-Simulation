Deadlocks:

Step 1: Initialization

Processes are allocated resources at the beginning of their execution.
Each process can request additional resources during its execution.

Step 2: Resource Allocation

Processes request resources as needed for their execution.
Resources can be of different types, and each process needs a certain number of instances of each resource type to complete its execution.

Step 3: Resource Hold

When a process successfully acquires a resource, it enters the "hold and wait" state.
The process holds the acquired resource(s) while it continues its execution.

Step 4: Request for Additional Resources

If a process requires additional resources during its execution and they are not available, the process enters the "waiting" state.
The process is now waiting for the requested resources to be released by other processes.

Step 5: Resource Request and Waiting Chain Formation

A situation arises where each process in a set is holding a resource that another process in the same set is waiting for.
This forms a circular chain of waiting, where each process waits for a resource held by the next process in the chain.

Step 6: Resource Deadlock

Once the circular chain of waiting is formed, no process in the chain can proceed.
Each process is waiting for a resource that will never be released since the process holding that resource is waiting for another resource in the chain.

Step 7: System Stagnation

The system is now in a state of deadlock, where no process can make progress.
Processes are effectively stuck, and no new processes can be executed because the required resources are unavailable due to the deadlock.

Step 8: Necessary Conditions for Deadlocks

Deadlocks occur due to the simultaneous presence of four necessary conditions: mutual exclusion, hold and wait, no preemption, and circular wait.

Step 9: Detecting and Handling Deadlocks

Systems can implement various deadlock detection and recovery mechanisms.
Deadlock detection involves periodically checking the resource allocation graph for circular wait conditions.
If a deadlock is detected, recovery strategies can be employed, such as process termination or resource preemption.

Step 10: Prevention and Avoidance

To prevent deadlocks, one or more of the necessary conditions must be eliminated.
Avoidance involves ensuring that the system never enters an unsafe state where deadlock is possible.
Various algorithms, like the Banker's Algorithm, can be used to ensure that resource allocations do not lead to deadlocks.

Step 11: Resource Release and Resolution

Deadlocks can be resolved by releasing resources from one or more processes.
This breaks the circular wait condition and allows the remaining processes to continue their execution.

Step 12: System Recovery

After deadlock resolution, the system recovers from the deadlock state and can continue executing processes.
