# Deadlocks-Algorithm-Simulation - The ‚ò†Ô∏èüîí Prevention Software

This Software is a C++ and Qt based university project which goal it is to visually understand the phenomenon of "deadlocks" in operating systems and to learn about algorithms for preventing them.

## Description
All the processes in a system require some resources such as central processing unit(CPU), file storage, input/output devices, etc to execute it. 

Once the execution is finished, the process releases the resource it was holding. However, when many processes run on a system they also compete for these resources they require for execution. This may arise a deadlock situation.

A **deadlock** is a situation in which more than one process is blocked because it is holding a resource and also requires some resource that is acquired by some other process. Therefore, none of the processes gets executed.

As you could guess: Deadlock prevention is a big and important topic, which is why there are many different approaches to prevention, reversal and elimination.
