Bankiers Algorithm:

This algorithm works by checking if the current state is save or not.
If the state is save the process can reserve the resource, otherwise the request will be rejected.

To check this there are three steps:

1. In the requirements matrix search for a row with values smaller or equal to array A, the currently free resources. If ther is none the state isn't save and the resources won't be reserved.

2. If a matching row was found it will be marked as finished and the resource counts are added to A, the currently free resources.

3. Repeat the steps 1 and 2 until all processes are marked as finished. If all were smaller or equal the current state is save, otherwise it's a possible deadlock and won't be reserved.

If the algorithm marked the current state as save the processWorker will aquire the resources needed by the requesting process.
