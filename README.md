# Deadlocks-Algorithm-Simulation - The Deadlock Prevention Simulation Software

DeadPrevSim is a C++ and Qt based university project which goal it is to visually understand the phenomenon of "deadlocks" in operating systems and to learn about algorithms for preventing them.

# Description
A Deadlock can be a quite bad situation for an operating system, if an important process is gated in a Deadlock situation and is not able to work properly, this can lead to a complete crash.
As you could guess: Deadlock prevention is a big and important topic, which is why there are many different approaches to prevention, reversal and elimination.

The program has 4 built-in algorithms to visually show you how they work against Deadlocks:
-Eliminate Hold And Wait
-Eliminate Circular Wait
-Eliminate No Preemption
-Bankier Algorithm
