Request:
When the process has requested to find the next resource, first the condition for the circular wait has to be eliminated.

Eliminate Circular wait:
To eliminate circular wait, the system must ensure that resource requests are made in a way that prevents a circular chain of waiting.
The simulated algorithm imposes a total ordering on resources, assigning a unique number (timestamp) to each resource (1. printer, 2. CD-ROM, 3. plotter, 4. tape drive).
Processes are allowed to request resources in increasing order of their timestamps, preventing circular chains. This is achieved by sorting their list of still-needed resources.

Reservation:
Now the next resource that has a count > 0 can be selected and reserved from the now sorted list.
