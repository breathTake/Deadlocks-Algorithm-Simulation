# Deadlocks-Algorithm-Simulation - The ‚ò†Ô∏èüîí Prevention Simulation Software

This Software is a C++ and Qt based university project which goal it is to visually understand the phenomenon of "deadlocks" in operating systems and to learn about algorithms for preventing them.

## Description
A Deadlock can be a quite bad situation for an operating system, if an important process is gated in a Deadlock situation and is not able to work properly, this can lead to a complete crash.

As you could guess: Deadlock prevention is a big and important topic, which is why there are many different approaches to prevention, reversal and elimination.

The program has 4 built-in algorithms to visually show you how they work against Deadlocks:

-Eliminate **Hold And Wait** ‚åõ

-Eliminate **Circular Wait** üîÉ

-Eliminate **No Preemption** üö¶

-**Bankier Algorithm** üí∏

Deadlocks are only able to occur if all four conditions are true. Each of the four algorithms is against one of those conditions, so you only need one algorithm and a Deadlock cannot be created. 

## Installation
1. Clone the GitHub repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/breathTake/Deadlocks-Algorithm-Simulation.git
   ```

2. Install any required dependencies and configurations as instructed in the project documentation.

3. Build the project using the appropriate build tool (e.g., CMake or qmake).

4. Launch the application and start simulating the network.

## Operation manual

### Get to know the Software
The GUI is seperated into four different parts, with each one is necessary for the complete software.
